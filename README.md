Code To Generate and Play Channa Horwitz's Sonakinatography I Movement #III


####The python code realizes in code the algorithm created by Horwitz for the creation of the piece. The python code generates a data abstraction that has been ported over to SuperCollider as seen in ‘lib/score.scd’. This data structure is iterated over and used to generate a piece for color and sound similar to Horwitz’s original, but this time fully automated.

# For Channa Horwitz
Code To Generate and Play Channa Horwitz's Sonakinatography I Movement #III


#### The python code realizes the algorithm created by Horwitz for the used for the drafting of her original score (which doubles as a piece of visual art). The python code generates a data abstraction that has been ported over to SuperCollider as seen in ‘lib/score.scd’. This data structure is iterated over and used to generate a piece for color and sound similar to Horwitz’s original, but this time fully automated.
